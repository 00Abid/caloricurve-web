Macronutrients: Protein, Carbs, Fats (auto-calculated)

🧠 Calculation Logic (JavaScript):
Uses Mifflin-St Jeor equation:

js
Copy
Edit
const bmr = gender === "Male"
  ? 10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age + 5
  : 10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age - 161;

const tdee = bmr * activityFactor;
const goalCalories = goal === "lose" ? tdee - 500 : goal === "gain" ? tdee + 500 : tdee;
Protein = 0.8g per kg, Carbs = 50% of calories, Fats = 25% of calories.

🧠 Stats Auto-Update
After calculation:

BMI = weight / (height/100)^2

Updates calorie progress and goal stats

Values are shown in the respective <h2> and <p> elements in .stats-box

📅 Today's Date Display
Today’s date shown in the format: Today: 29 July 2025

Also saved in localStorage for persistence:

js
Copy
Edit
const today = new Date();
const formatted = today.toLocaleDateString("en-GB", { day: "numeric", month: "long", year: "numeric" });
document.getElementById("todayDate").innerText = "Today: " + formatted;
localStorage.setItem("todayDate", formatted);
💾 LocalStorage Use
